# CONTRIBUTING to Open Cosmics

Thank you for wanting to contribute to Open Cosmics! You can join this project and participate in several ways. Read on to find out more.

## Listing cosmic-ray projects

If you are working on any cosmic-ray projects or are aware of ones that make their data available publicly, please [create an issue](https://github.com/OpenCosmics/opencosmics.github.io/issues/) to let us know. It would be great if you could also include any contact details when you create the issue, so we know whom to get in touch with.

## Testing the Open Cosmics data format

We hope that the Open Cosmics data format is compatible with data from all existing cosmic-ray projects and that future projects adopt it as well. We are always looking to improve the format and its specifications. If you think the they are lacking in any way, please [let us know](https://github.com/OpenCosmics/opencosmics.github.io/issues/).

## Open analysis tools

The study of cosmic rays is an excellent introduction to particle physics. If you have written any code to analysis open cosmic-ray data, [please get in touch](https://github.com/OpenCosmics/opencosmics.github.io/issues/) and let us know if we can showcase your code so that others may benefit.

## General contributions

It's very possible that the Open Cosmics website and resources may have some mistakes in them. Your help in correcting them will be invaluable, so if you come across any typos etc., [please make sure to inform us](https://github.com/OpenCosmics/opencosmics.github.io/issues/) and we will fix them immediately.
